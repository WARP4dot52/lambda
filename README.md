###Lambda (a dark mode for Epsilon)


for legal reason i cant share binaries but you can compile it yourself

check [this for sdk installation ](https://github.com/UpsilonNumworks/Upsilon/tree/upsilon-dev?tab=readme-ov-file#2-set-up-repo)
and [this for flashing in calculator (userland)](https://ti-planet.github.io/webdfu_numworks/n0110/)

for building you should use these commands : `make clean`  `make userland.A.bin -j$(nproc)`


(you can replace userland.A.bin by userland.B.bin depending on which slot you want the os to install on)


btw ik my code is a total mess and probably completly buggy
